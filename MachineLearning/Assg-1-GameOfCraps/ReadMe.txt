Title - Machine Learning Assignment - 1 Simulate Game of Craps

Best Strategy - Reverse Martingale
This strategy is best according to me because it is a good idea to double your bet when you win once. When a person looses, it is not a good idea to increase the bet. 
Also the game is purely dependent on chance(dice roll), it is hard to predict the most favourable strategy for maximising the profit.
