Q5: Cassandra CQL3
{cs6360:~} /usr/local/apache-cassandra-2.0.5/bin/cqlsh  csac0

Requirements:
Using Cassandra CQL3, write commands to do the following:
1- Create a table for business.csv dataset. Use (business_id) as the Primary Key.
2- Load all records in the dataset to this table.
3- Select the tuple which has business id  'HPWmjuivv3xJ279qSVfNaQ'
4- Delete all rows in the table.
5- Drop the table.


Solution-

To start Cassandra - 
{cs6360:~} /usr/local/apache-cassandra-2.0.5/bin/cqlsh  csac0

//Creating Keyspace-
CREATE KEYSPACE kxk140230 WITH  REPLICATION = {'class' :'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1};

//use keyspace
USE kxk140230;

//create new table with following columns
CREATE TABLE businesstable
(
business_id varchar,
full_address varchar,
categories text, 
PRIMARY KEY (business_id)
);

//Load all records into Table from business.csv
COPY kxk140230.businesstable(business_id,full_address,categories) FROM 'business.csv' WITH DELIMITER ='^';

//select tuples with business_id= 'HPWmjuivv3xJ279qSVfNaQ'
SELECT * FROM businesstable WHERE business_id= 'HPWmjuivv3xJ279qSVfNaQ';

//delete all rows from table
TRUNCATE businesstable;

//Drop Table
DROP TABLE businesstable;
