Q1:

List the business_id , full address and categories of the Top 10 businesses located in CA using the average ratings. This will require you to use  review.csv and business.csv files.

Please answer the question by calculating the average ratings given to each business using the
review.csv file. Do not use the already calculated ratings (average_stars) contained in the
business entity rows.

Solution-

businessFile= LOAD '/kxk140230/busNew' USING PigStorage('^') AS (busID:chararray,fAddress:chararray,categories:chararray);

filteredBusinessID= FILTER businessFile by(fAddress matches'.*CA.*');

reviewFile = LOAD '/yelpdatafall/review/review.csv' USING PigStorage('^') AS (review_id:chararray,user_id:chararray,busID:chararray,stars:float);

join_columns= JOIN filteredBusinessID by busID, reviewFile by busID;

groupReview = GROUP reviewFile by busID;

avgStars = FOREACH groupReview generate group as busID, AVG($1.stars) AS ratingsAvg;

joinBusinessReview = JOIN filteredBusinessID by busID, avgStars by busID;

filteredBR = FILTER joinBusinessReview by fAddress is not null and categories is not null;

busID_sorted = ORDER filteredBR by ratingsAvg DESC;

outputBusinessID= LIMIT busID_sorted 10;
STORE outputBusinessID into '/kxk140230/pigQ1' using PigStorage ('|');
